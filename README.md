# Omakwin
Inspired by [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub), Omakwin is the Windows 11 version of that concept for indie game developers.  

Omakwin configures Windows 11 to get out of your way without the need to write your own configs or registry edits and turns Windows 11 into a fully-configured game development environment; all with with a single command. Initial support planned for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and homebrew development with Game Boy (GB) and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). More environments will be added later.
